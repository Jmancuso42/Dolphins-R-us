                <p>Dolphins are highly social animals and are known for their complex and sophisticated social relationships. They live in groups called pods, which can range in size from just a few individuals to several hundred. Within these pods, dolphins have a hierarchical social structure and form close bonds with other members of the group. They communicate with each other through a variety of vocalizations, body language, and touch. </p>
